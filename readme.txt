Object Detection using SSD Mobilenet v3 model Trained on large COCO dataset
Here Iâ€™ve used SSD model to detect pretrained objects in an image or video.
There are 91 different classification classes on which model can detect object and bounding boxes.

Require Libraries
1. Numpy
2. Computer vision (cv2)
3. Pillow (PIL)
